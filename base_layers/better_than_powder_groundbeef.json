So did I.  They're terrible, right?  Here's something better:\n\nDice a half-onion, sautee and season liberally with salt, pepper, and ground cumin.\n\nBrown a pound of ground beef, seasoning liberally with ground cumin, salt, pepper.  Add tabasco/other hot sauce if you like.\n\nWhen beef is browned, add a small jar of salsa (any kind!  i like corn/black bean tomato salsa), and simmer for 5-10 minutes.\n\nEnjoy.  Serve with crispy taco shells for nostalgia.\n", "slug": "better_than_powder_groundbeef", "uuid": "db72eb7c-64e9-11ea-a147-acde48001122"}
