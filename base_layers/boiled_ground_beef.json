This process requires a bit more time, but it's totally worth it.\n\n__Ingredients__\n\n* 2 pounds lean ground beef\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1 teaspoon chili powder\n* 2 teaspoons cumin\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* 1 onion, minced\n* enough water to completely cover the meat _(Beef broth also works well!)_\n\n\n__Directions__\n\nPlace all ingredients in a large pan over high heat. Bring to boil. Turn down to medium/medium low heat and simmer for 1 hour. Use a potato masher to break apart the meat.\n\nStrain away any leftover liquid. If you are making this ahead of time you can place the leftover liquid in the fridge to harden the grease. Spoon off any hardened grease and add a little liquid back to the meat if you are reheating it.\n\n---\n\n_(Credit belongs to my wife, Jamie.
