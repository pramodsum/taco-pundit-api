Here's the ones I made tonight:\n\n* 1lb rib eye steak, cubed into ~1\" cubes\n* Salsa verde, your choice, about 2-3 Tbs\n* Pinch or two of mexican oregano\n* A few healthy sprinkles of chili powder\n\nCube up your steak, mix everything together, cover and let sit for a half hour or so.\n\nWhen everything else is ready to go, pan-fry (or, skewer and grill if you're feeling ambitious), until cooked to your chosen meat level.", "slug": "chopped_steak", "uuid": "db72133c-64e9-11ea-a147-acde48001122"}
