I also tweaked the spices.\n\nYou'll need:\n\n* Fresh corn kernels, cut off the cob.\n* 1 can of Black Beans\n* half a white onion\n* salt\n* chili powder\n* cumin\n\nDirections\n----------\n\n1. Toast corn in a skillet over high heat with oil and salt for about 5 minutes, or until browned. Remove corn.\n2. Cook onion in the skillet until it caramelizes (about 5 minutes). Leave onion in there.\n3. Add corn back in.\n4. Add black beans.\n5. Toss in a pinch of salt, a healthy couple shakes of chili powder, and a small pinch of cumin.\n6. Cook together for another 5 minute or so.\n\nDelicious hot as the main base_layer or as a supplement to others.\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n", "slug": "corn_and_black_beans", "uuid": "2f05ab16-64eb-11ea-820b-acde48001122"}
