Combine tongue, onion, bay leaves, carrot, and garlic in a saucepan. \n2. Add stock until mostly covered. \n3. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, cover with lid, and cook four to six hours until completely tender (depends on the size of the tongue).\n4. Add water as necessary to keep the tongue mostly submerged.\n5. Move tongue to a cutting board. \n6. Strain stock and chuck the solids, keeping the liquid for later. \n7. Peel the outer membrane off the tongue and discard. Chop tongue into 1/2-inch pieces. \n\nWhen ready to serve, heat oil in a large non-stick skillet set over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add tongue and cook, stirring occasionally, until tongue is well browned on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes total. \n\nNOTE: The first seven steps can be done well in advance.
