{"name": "Taco de rajas poblanas", "url": "https://raw.github.com/sinker/tacofancy/master/base_layers/rajas_poblanas.md", "recipe": "* Bunch of poblano peppers\n* Onion\n* Tad of oil\n* Mexican crema or sour cream\n* *optionally*, fresh corn\n* *optionally*, queso Oaxaca or panela or fresco\n\nStart with 1 or more produce-section bags of Poblano peppers,\nit's handy if the bags are not totally full for a subsequent step.\n\nPlace the Poblano peppers over an open flame, typically directly\nover a natural gas burner on a stove. Their skin will bubble and blister,\nrotate and rearrange them with tongs until the burns, bubbles, and\nblisters are evenly distributed around the chiles and you feel a tingle\nin your upper sinuses. Put the singed peppers back in the produce bags,\nthen close the bags tightly to 'sweat' the chiles inside.\n\nWhile the chiles are sweating, sautee some onion slices in a pan.\nOptionally, add some pre-cooked whole kernels of corn when the onion is\nalmost done.\n\nTake the chiles out of the bag. Their skin will be wilted and will come off\nin your fingers. Peel the outer layer of the chiles off and discard. Once\nthe outer skin is removed, de-vein the rest and remove the seeds. Then\ncut the flesh into thinninsh strips.\n\nAdd the chile strips (the 'rajas') back into the pan with the onion. Get it\nall hot and finish cooking any bits of chile that remain raw after the\nskin removal process. When it looks close to done, lower the cooking heat\nto a minimum and add the cream and cheese(s) and warm them for about 5 minutes.\n\ntags: vegetarian\n", "slug": "taco_de_rajas_poblanas"}
