Maybe even the best.\n\n* 1 Surly fist full of green beans\n* half a beer\n* quarter cup vegetable broth\n* 2 cloves garlic\n* 1 Tbsp olive oil\n* some salt, whatever\n\nFirst peel and dice the garlic and saut\u00e9 it in the olive oil. Before it gets all burned and ruined, add the beer and vegetable broth.\n\nAs the liquid comes to a boil, cut the green beans up. Add the green beans and a pinch of salt and let them simmer for about five minutes. If you like your beans on the softer side you can let it go a little longer. But the trick is to pull them right after the color starts to turn and you've just made a delicious addition to any taco.\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n", "slug": "drunken_green_beans"}
