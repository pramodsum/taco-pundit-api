They pack a powerfully tart punch, and add some crunch to a taco that might need some textural assistance.\n\n__Instructions__\n\nYou want a pomegranate that feels heavy for its size and has a firm, tight skin. (Weight and firmness are indicators of how much juice is inside.)\n\nHere are two methods for getting the seeds out of the membrane:\n\n___The Water Method___\n\n1. Fill a clean sink or large bowl with cold water (not *too* cold as your hands are going to be working in the water).\n2. Use a small knife to cut out the stem end of the pomegranate, then use your hands to break the whole fruit into large pieces.\n3. Holding the large pieces under the water, use your hands to gently separate the seeds from the membrane. The papery bits will conveniently float to the surface for easy removal.\n\n___The Wooden Spoon Method___\n\n1. Use a small knife to cut out the stem end of the pomegranate, then use your hands to break the whole fruit into two halves.\n2. Loosely hold one of the halves in the palm of your hand, open side down, over a large bowl.\n3. Using a wooden spoon, smack the top, breaking loose the seeds, which will fall into your hand and through your fingers into the bowl.\n\nThis method is quick, but it takes some practice to be able to do it quickly without splashing juice. [Here's a great video demonstrating the technique.](http://lifehacker.com/5895852/deseed-a-pomegranate-in-10-seconds-using-a-wooden-spoon)\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n", "slug": "pomegranate_seeds", "uuid": "db7402dc-64e9-11ea-a147-acde48001122"}
