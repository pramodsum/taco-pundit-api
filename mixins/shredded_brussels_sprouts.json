Shred up your brussels sprouts so that they're flaked up. You're really going for almost a slaw-level shredding here.\n\n2. Put a healthy amount of butter in a pan, melt it down with a little salt too.\n\n3. Toss the shredded sprouts in, and fry 'em up until parts of them are browned up, and other parts have turned into a bright green. You're going for partial caramelization, but not all the way.\n\nYou're not going to LOAD UP your taco with these, but they bring an amazing, mellow flavor to the mix. Especially good with fish tacos.\n\ntags: vegetarian\n", "slug": "shredded_brussels_sprouts", "uuid": "db73eb1c-64e9-11ea-a147-acde48001122"}
