Now you can.\n\nA few tips before starting:\n\n* Don't be a cowboy (or cowgirl)-use gloves. You are going to be handling a lot of peppers and the last thing you want to do is touch your eye or a more _sensitive_ body part.\n* Have good ventilation. Especially on the day you bring your chilis to a boil.\n\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 1 pound red jalepe\u00f1o pepper, stemmed, seeded and halved.\n* \u00bd pound red serrano  pepper, stemmed, seeded and halved.\n* \u00bc pound red thai chiles, stemmed, and halved.\n* 6 cloves garlic, peeled.\n* 1 tablespoon kosher salt.\n* 4 tablespoons palm sugar (light brown sugar can be substituted, see notes).\n* \u00bd cup cane vinegar (or rice wine vinegar, [see notes](https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy/blob/master/seasonings/homemade_sriracha.md#notes)).\n\n### Directions\n\n1. Combine chilis, garlic, salt and sugar in food processor. Pulse to a coarse pure\u00e9.\n2. Transfer pure\u00e9 to glass container. Store at room temperature for one week, stirring daily (see notes).\n3. After one week, transfer pure\u00e9 to small saucepan, add vinegar and bring to boil.\n4. Reduce heat and simmer for five minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature.\n5. Transfer pure\u00e9 to food processor and process for two to three minutes.\n6. Strain pure\u00e9 through fine mesh strainer, using back of spoon or rubber spatula to press solids through strainer.\n7. Transfer finished sauce to glass jars and refrigerate. Can be stored for up to 6 months.\n\n### Notes\n\n* Any combination of red chile peppers will make a fine sriracha. Note thai chilis and serrano are hotter than jalepe\u00f1os, so experiment with different combinations and find one that works for your taste.\n* If you can't find palm sugar (usually found in most Asian markets) light brown sugar can be substituted. Light brown sugar is slightly sweeter so you may want to start with three tablespoons and adjust after tasting before step 3.\n* Likewise, if you cannot find cane vinegar, rice wine vinegar can be substituted. Seasoned rice wine vinegar, commonly used in preparing sushi rice often has been sweetened, so keep that in mind if adjusting sweetener.\n* Some recipes have suggested the pure\u00e9 can be thick after the seven day fermentation and water can be used to thin the mixture when processing after the boiling/simmering stage.\n* Finally, and **most importantly** be sure to santize the glass jars/containers you use to ferment and store your sriracha. Just ask your favorite homebrewer what can happen if you do not properly sanitize your glass container before storing foodstuffs in them.\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n", "slug": "homemade_sriracha", "uuid": "2f0982a4-64eb-11ea-820b-acde48001122"}
