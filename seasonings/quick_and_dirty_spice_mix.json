You own a skillet of some sort. You have some jars of jankity-ass spices from who-knows-when. You want to eat some tacos within the next, like, fifteen minutes. I got you covered, bachelor(ette).\n\n* 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour\n* 2 1/2 tsp. chili powder\n* 3/4 tsp. onion powder (or 1 1/2 tsp. minced yellow onion)\n* 1 1/4 tsp. salt\n* 1 tsp. paprika\n* 3/4 tsp beef bouillon powder\n* 1/4 tsp. granulated sugar\n* 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper\n* 1/4 tsp. garlic powder\n* 1 tsp. cumin\n\nPut all this in something with a lid, add 3/4 cup of water, and shake it. Brown a pound of ground beef, then pour the whole situation in there. Stir. Cook it down until it looks like you only put in half a cup of water. You have tacos now.\n\nVegetarians\n-----------\n\nI\u2019ve made this with that soy protein \u201cground beef\u201d and it does not _surprisingly_ taste like someone put spices on a stack of cheap bar coasters and ran it all through a blender. (Vegetable) oil the skillet when you\u2019re dealing with that stuff, unless you\u2019re looking for excuses to buy a new one.\n\nIf you leave out the bouillon for the sake of doing things vegan-style you\u2019ll probably want to nudge up the salt a little.\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n", "slug": "quick_and_dirty_spice_mix"}
