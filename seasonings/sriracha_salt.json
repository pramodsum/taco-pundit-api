Sriracha\n\nMix the two ingredients together in a bowl. Spread it out on a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper. Put in a 200-degree oven, then turn the oven off and let it sit overnight inside. It will clump, but place in ziplock bag and attack it with a rolling pin. Tada!\n\nThe effect on most food is as awesome as you'd expect but it is especially amazing with eggs. Add it to your breakfast tacos.\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n", "slug": "sriracha_salt", "uuid": "2f08f7da-64eb-11ea-820b-acde48001122"}
