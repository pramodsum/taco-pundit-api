I keep a jar of it in the cupboard at all times.\n\n* 6 tbsp chili powder\n* 4 tbsp cumin\n* 4 tbsp corn starch\n* 3 tbsp onion powder\n* 1 tbsp salt\n* 1 tbsp garlic powder\n* 4 tsp oregano (Mexican oregano, if you've got it)\n* 2 tsp crushed red pepper\n\nCombine in Mason jar and shake well to combine.\n\nThis mix works well for chicken, pork and beef, destined for the grill, oven, slow cooker or stovetop. You could tweak it a bit to target a specific meat, but I like to have a base, universal mix around. Makes it super easy to turn leftover anything into delicious taco filling: Just chop up whatever it is, toss it into a skillet, sprinkle generously with seasoning, then add a bit of water and simmer to impart flavor.\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n", "slug": "universal_taco_seasoning", "uuid": "2f090a22-64eb-11ea-820b-acde48001122"}
