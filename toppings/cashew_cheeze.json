Cover with a kitchen towel and allow to soak for 2-4 hours. Drain the cashews and rinse well.\nAdd the soaked cashews, salt, nutritional yeast, jalepeno and the lemon juice in a blender or food processor. Blend on high and stir frequently scraping down the sides of the bowl. Keep processing the mixture until it is very smooth, and there are no lumps.\nFold in the lemon zest (optional) and add to a serving bowl. You can also add a bit more water to get more of a creamy texture and store in a squeeze bottle (That's my preference anyway).\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n", "slug": "cashew_cheeze"}
