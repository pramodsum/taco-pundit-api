Prepare the oven for broiling by moving a single rack to the highest level. It should be no closer than 2-3 inches from the broiler.\n2. Under this rack set the second rack and the sheet pan covered with tin foil to catch drips from the corn.\n3. Brush each ear of corn lightly with oil.\n4. Pull out top rack halfway and place the corn directly on the rack.\n5. Push the rack in and turn on the broiler.\n6. Watch the corn. You're looking for some fairly blackened bits and lots of dark brown.\n7. Note: Do not let the corn catch on fire.\n8. Turn the corn one quarter turn with the tongs. Repeat until each corn ear is fairly dark brown.\n9. Remove the corn ears to the large metal bowl they are fully turned and browned/charred.\n10. Turn off the broiler.\n11. Let the corn cool for 15 minutes or until you can touch it.\n12. Stand an ear of corn up on the bottom.\n13. Using your sharpest knife, start at the top of the corn ear and slice down through the kernels. They will come off in sheets.\n14. Turn the corn a quarter or a fifth turn and repeat until you've removed the kernels. Note: Some will stick at the top and bottom.\n15. Do this for each ear of corn.\n16. Now you have a bowl full of kernels. Mix with lime juice (2 limes?) and 3-6 oz of cotija to make a corn salad.\n17. BONUS: Freeze the cobs. Later, make corn stock by boiling the cobs for an hour in 2 gallons of water. Remove the cobs and reduce to about 2 quarts. Use with grits or as a soup base.\n", "slug": "charred_corn"}
