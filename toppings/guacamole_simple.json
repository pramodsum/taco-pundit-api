Scoop the avocado meat into a bowl and mash them with a fork. Leave it a bit lumpy as we will do more stirring in a bit and we don't want to over-work them.\n2. Add the chopped tomato.\n3. Add the lime juice; hold some back for later adjustment).\n4. Add \u00bdt salt.\n5. Add 2T hot sauce.\n6. Stir with the fork again.\n7. Taste.\n8. Adjust salt/lime/hot sauce as desired.\n\nThis recipe will support one average-size bag of chips, so adjust quantities based on expectations.\n\ntags: vegetarian\n", "slug": "guacamole_simple"}
