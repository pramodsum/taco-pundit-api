Then you add the garlic, onion, spices, peppers if you're heating it up, and then **walk away**.\n\nSeriously, walk away for a minute. Crack open a nice Negra Modelo and use a wedge of the other half of the lime in it. Back in your bowl, let the strong stuff marinate in that lime juice for a few minutes. It's cooking.\n\nOK, now that you're back, mix in the rest of the non-avocado ingredients. If you have a pestle, now's it's time to shine. If not, use a small wooden spoon, or failing all else, a fork, you miserable lout. \n\nMash up everything but the avocado. Get it pasty if you can. Squish it all up.\n\nNow you can add your avocado or two, dude. I usually go with about 1.5 avos to condiment tacos or taco-like structures for four humans of varying sizes.\n\nJust in case no one ever taught you how to deal with an avocado correctly, here's a quick lesson:\n* Cut it in half, longways.\n* Smack the pit with the sharp edge of your knife and give it a sensible 90-degree twist.\n* Voila, the avocado pit is on your knife.\n* Dispose of it, unless you're not going to finish all that guac now, in which case, hang onto it and put it in the bowl with the guac before you put it in the fridge.\n* Now that your knife is free, use it to carve long slices into the flesh of your avocado, one half at a time. Cross-hatch that sucker a bit. Don't cut through the flesh.\n* Finally, get your avocado half above your nice bowl full of deliciousness, and use the skin to gently push your nice slices into the spicy soup below. Turn it inside-out, if you must, but know that you can minimize the amount of avocado that gets all over your hands if you do this just right.\n\nTo finish up your guacamole, mash your avocado up a bit and gently mix it into the magical citric-spice-tomato concoction. We're done here.\n\n_Thanks to [The Awl](http://www.theawl.com/2010/02/half-baked-guacamole-by-the-ceviche-method) for limited inspiration regarding the limey and drinky parts._\n\ntags: vegetarian\n",

Rotate the\nchiles around and let them get dark brown to black without actually burning them \u2014\nthis can happen quickly, which is good because your eyes, nose, and lungs\nmay reach their maximum vaporized chile tolerance during this step.\n\nAdd a bunch of chopped onion and garlic and lower the heat.

Cook until the tomatoes look stewed.\nIf you have one of those blender wands that you can put directly in a saucepan,\nyou can blend everything now (you may end up making this sauce frequently enough\nto justify the purchase of a blender wand.)

Stick the jar in a dark place for about 24 hours. Open the lid to let out the gasses that have been wanting to get out, then close it up again and put it in the fridge.\n6. Wait two more days, and voila, you have kimchi. Some people sya that it's best to wait at least a week before eating; it will last about a month.\n\nLots of other vegetables can be added; play around with it.\n\n__Pur\u00e9ed Kimchi__\n\nThanks to Momofuku, we know that pur\u00e9eing kimchi takes a lot of the sweater smell out of it, and creates a smoother and rounder flavor, and is fantastic for squeezing onto tacos.",

    "recipe": "Ingredients\n------------\n* 1 bag cranberries\n* 1 cup water\n* 3/4 cup sugar\n* half a small white onion (chopped)\n* 1 jalepe\u00f1o, chopped small (remove seeds & wash for less heat)\n* 1 bunch cilantro (cut up)\n* 1 lime\n\nDirections\n-----------\n1. In a saucepan, get your water and sugar boiling, then add the cranberries. Boil until the cranberries pop (5-10 minutes), then take off heat, drain, and cool. They'll be slightly jelly-like, but you don't want them to disintegrate entirely, so watch them closely.\n\n2. While the cranberries are cooling, chop your white onion, your jalepe\u00f1o and cilantro.\n\n3. Once your berries are cool, they'll probably have turned gooey. If there is still a bunch of water, drain it. But it's probably turned to jelly.\n\n4. Combine everything, and give a good squeeze of lime over the whole thing. As you combine, you'll notice that the cranberries just give up their shape entirely. Also: Don't wear your finest clothing when you do this--this shit _stains_.\n\n5. Make adjustments based on taste here. Your main variables are:\n\t* Sweet vs tangy. Default right now is tangy. Add more sugar for sweet.\n\t* Battling the overwhelmingness of the cranberries. You've got two things going with the cranberries here: flavor and texture. More onion will add more crunch to the whole thing, and help boost up the salsa-ness. Jalepe\u00f1o is your heat adjustment--seeds are your friend. But the Cilantro is your big mover here: it helps to round out the sharpness of the cranberry. Lime also helps bring down the cranberry overload.\n\n\nOrange Cranberry Salsa Holographic Varient Cover\n------------------------------------------------\n\n* Go with half a cup of OJ and half a cup of water to boil your berries in.\n* Compliment the lime juice with a fresh squeezed orange and then *zest* that motherfucker right into the salsa\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n",

    "recipe": "charred corn\n=========\n* 6-8 ears of very fresh sweet corn.\n* Canola, peanut or other high-heat vegetable oil.\n* Sheet pan covered with tin foil.\n* Good long tongs.\n* Large metal bowl.\n\n1. Prepare the oven for broiling by moving a single rack to the highest level. It should be no closer than 2-3 inches from the broiler.\n2. Under this rack set the second rack and the sheet pan covered with tin foil to catch drips from the corn.\n3. Brush each ear of corn lightly with oil.\n4. Pull out top rack halfway and place the corn directly on the rack.\n5. Push the rack in and turn on the broiler.\n6. Watch the corn. You're looking for some fairly blackened bits and lots of dark brown.\n7. Note: Do not let the corn catch on fire.\n8. Turn the corn one quarter turn with the tongs. Repeat until each corn ear is fairly dark brown.\n9. Remove the corn ears to the large metal bowl they are fully turned and browned/charred.\n10. Turn off the broiler.\n11. Let the corn cool for 15 minutes or until you can touch it.\n12. Stand an ear of corn up on the bottom.\n13. Using your sharpest knife, start at the top of the corn ear and slice down through the kernels. They will come off in sheets.\n14. Turn the corn a quarter or a fifth turn and repeat until you've removed the kernels. Note: Some will stick at the top and bottom.\n15. Do this for each ear of corn.\n16. Now you have a bowl full of kernels. Mix with lime juice (2 limes?) and 3-6 oz of cotija to make a corn salad.\n17. BONUS: Freeze the cobs. Later, make corn stock by boiling the cobs for an hour in 2 gallons of water. Remove the cobs and reduce to about 2 quarts. Use with grits or as a soup base.\n",
