Add the sugar and store the mixture in your refrigerator to marinate and pickle, the longer the better.\n\nPick out the rings and place them on your brisket taco. Eat.\n\nVariations\n----------\n\nPickled onions are a favorite in the Von Doom house, too. [@littlewhirl](http://twitter.com/littlewhirl) played around with a similar starting point and we use this brine instead:\n\n* 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar\n* 1 T Sugar (I usually use coconut palm sugar because I'm a hippie I guess)\n* Water\n* 1 1/2 tsp salt\n* 1 sprig fresh oregano and/or cilantro (optional)\n\nSlice 1 red onion on a mandolin (WORTH IT). In a bowl melt the sugar and salt with some warm/hot water. Add vinegar and 1c of filtered water.\nAdd in onion, top off w/ water so that the onion is just covered.\nVERY IMPORTANT: Let sit at room temp for at least an hour. Trust me.\n\nThe apple cider vinegar is a tangier but also more subtle, keeping more of the onion flavor there. And using a partial salt water brine lets it work nice for quick pickles, but also for slightly longer engagements. Leading to the most important aspect:\n\nPICKLE ALL THE THINGS\n---------------------\n\nSeriously. All the things. Pickle your fridge. Pickle your waffles. Make. Lots. Of. Pickles.\n\n* __Cabbage__ \u2014 red or green work. You only need an hour or so (like onions)\n* __Jalepe\u00f1os__ \u2014 seriously GTFO these are good. Add dill for a twist. Add parboiled carrots if you want to cut the spice\n* __Greenbeans__ \u2014 because greenbeans are goddam delicious\n* __Toy cars \u2014 kid with an attitude? Pickle their favorite toy car. Let's see them try to cop a tude when their matchbox cars are soggy and briney\n* __Cauliflower__ \u2014 personal favorite. Pickles in an hour, super delicious\n* __Baby corn__ \u2014 baby corn is gross, but if you pickle it you can make jokes about how big all the other things you pickled are\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n", "slug": "pickled_red_onions"}
