If you can't find one of these peppers, swap in another one!\n\n* 6 Average-sized tomatillos\n* 1 Poblano pepper\n* 1 Serrano pepper\n* 1 Jalapeno pepper\n* 1 Sweet red pepper\n* Juice of 1 or 2 fresh-squeezed limes (to taste)\n* Pinch or two kosher salt (to taste)\n\nYou're in charge of the heat here. For a milder salsa, remove all the ribs and seeds inside the peppers. For medium, leave in a few ribs, and for hot, go nuts. Rough chop the peppers and tomatillos, then throw into a blender or food processor with salt and lime juice. Pulse to desired consistency.\n\nAs with most salsas, this will taste better if you let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before eating. It's great on chips or drizzled over steak or pork tacos.\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n", "slug": "simple_salsa_verde", "uuid": "db712242-64e9-11ea-a147-acde48001122"}
